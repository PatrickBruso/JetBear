## Coding JetBear with Pygame!

I coded a javascript game a long time ago.  The game isn't great but was the best I could do with vanilla JS at the time. Now that I've been working with Python I want to finally implement it using Pygame.

My idea is to create a 2D background scrolling game where you control a bear to go up and down in order to catch salmon and avoid beehives. I also want to add a splash screen and a game over/high score screen.  This basic implementation is to test my skills and knowledge of Python/Pygame, at which point I will hopefully add more features.

The goal for now is to implement the following:

* [x] Create Splash Screen
    * [x] Create Splash Screen Music
    * [x] Create Moving Background on Splash Screen
* [x] Load Game on Click
    * [x] Create Start Button
* [x] Implement Game Scene after Start Click
* [ ] Game Mechanics
    * [x] Implement Character Sprite for Jetpack On/Off
        * [x] Jetpack Turns on with Space Click
        * [ ] Jetpack Movement Physics
    * [ ] Score Graphic
    * [x] Side-Scrolling Background
    * [ ] Potential Enemies
    * [ ] High Score Table
* [ ] Game Music
